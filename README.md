# 🔄 Application Flow

1. User registers or logs in.
2. Backend verifies credentials and returns JWT token.
3. Token is stored in Zustand (persisted storage).
4. Protected routes validate authentication.
5. Products are fetched from backend.
6. Cart is managed globally via Zustand.
7. Orders are created and stored in MongoDB.

---

# 🔐 Authentication Flow

* Login uses OAuth2 password flow.
* JWT token is generated on backend.
* Axios interceptor attaches token to every request.
* ProtectedRoute blocks unauthorized access.
